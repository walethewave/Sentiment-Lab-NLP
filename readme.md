## 👋 Why Sentiment Lab?

As an AI engineer and data scientist, I’ve often faced the challenge of transforming raw, messy text into actionable insights—especially in fast-moving domains like social media.

Manual approaches are slow, error-prone, and don’t scale. I built **Sentiment Lab** to automate, standardize, and accelerate sentiment analysis workflows so teams can focus on what matters: **understanding their users** and making **data-driven decisions**.

---

## 🧐 Problem Statement

Text data is everywhere, but extracting sentiment is hard.

- Social media, reviews, and feedback are noisy, unstructured, and full of irrelevant information.  
- Existing tools are either too rigid, too complex, or lack transparency.  
- Teams need a robust, reproducible, and extensible pipeline that works out of the box.

---

## 💡 Solution Overview

**Sentiment Lab** is a modular, production-ready sentiment analysis pipeline built in Python.

- ✅ Raw data ingestion (CSV)  
- ✅ Preprocessing with NLTK and Scikit-learn  
- ✅ TF-IDF feature engineering  
- ✅ Naive Bayes classification  
- ✅ Evaluation and validation  
- ✅ Fully extensible architecture

---

## ✨ Key Features

- 📦 **Plug-and-Play Pipeline** – from raw data to predictions  
- 🧹 **Advanced Preprocessing** – cleaning, stopwords, tokenization  
- 📊 **TF-IDF Vectorization** – high-dimensional feature extraction  
- 🤖 **Fast Model Training** – interpretable Naive Bayes model  
- 🧪 **Validation Support** – training + external test sets  
- 📝 **Synthetic Data Generation** – for benchmarking  
- 🔍 **Exploratory Analysis** – tools for inspection and plotting  
- 🛠️ **Extensible Design** – swap any component  
- 🖥️ **Cross-Platform** – Windows, macOS, Linux compatible


### 🚀 Minimal Example

```python
from pipeline import SentimentLab

pipeline = SentimentLab()
pipeline.train()
pipeline.predict("I love this product!")
# Output: 'positive'
```

## 📚 Documentation

| Step          | Description                         | Example                   |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Data Loading  | Load CSVs with/without headers      | `pd.read_csv("file.csv")` |
| Preprocessing | Clean, tokenize, remove stopwords   | `TextPreprocessor()`      |
| Feature Eng.  | TF-IDF vectorization                | `TfidfVectorizer()`       |
| Modeling      | Train/test split, Naive Bayes       | `MultinomialNB()`         |
| Evaluation    | Accuracy, F1, classification report | `classification_report()` |

---

## 🔍 Example: Predicting Sentiment for a Single Review

```python
review = "This movie was absolutely fantastic!"
pipeline.predict(review)
# Output: 'positive'
```

---

## ⚙️ Configuration Options

* **Data files**: Place `twitter_training.csv`, `twitter_validation.csv` in project root
* **Stopwords**: Uses NLTK English list by default (customizable)
* **Model**: `MultinomialNB` (default); easily replaceable
* **Vectorizer**: TF-IDF; or switch to `CountVectorizer`

---

## 🧯 Troubleshooting

| Issue                    | Solution                                  |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| `LookupError: stopwords` | `import nltk; nltk.download('stopwords')` |
| Shape mismatch errors    | Ensure train/val preprocessing match      |
| Poor accuracy            | Check for class imbalance or data leakage |
| `UnicodeDecodeError`     | Use `encoding='utf-8'` in `pd.read_csv()` |

---

## 📊 Example Workflow

```python
# Example: Create training pair
["video", "games", "have", "evolved", "into"] -> Target: "a"

# Vectorize text
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(corpus_df.Sentence)

# Train model
model = MultinomialNB()
model.fit(X, y)

# Predict next word
predict_word("video games have evolved into")
# Output: 'a' or similar

# Generate sentence
generate_sentence("game is good to play")
# Output: 'game is good to play and the to a gaming the and the...'
```

---

## 📝 Example Generated Sentences

Here are a few samples generated by the model to showcase its creativity and contextual understanding:

> **Input:** `the hero must`
> **Output:** `the hero must find the lost sword`

> **Input:** `after the battle`
> **Output:** `after the battle the village was silent`

> **Input:** `choose your weapon`
> **Output:** `choose your weapon wisely before the fight`

## 📚 Dataset Summary

A glimpse into the emotional depth and style variety of the dataset:

```text
"the princess waited in the tower"         [emotion: anticipation]
"victory was bittersweet for the hero"     [emotion: bittersweet]
"the city lights flickered in the rain"    [emotion: melancholy]
```

* **Source**: Extracted and curated from game scripts, lore entries, and fan fiction
* **Emotional Labels**: Annotated to allow **emotion-aware predictions** and future mood-driven generation
